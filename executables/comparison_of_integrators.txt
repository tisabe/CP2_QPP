The Euler integrator takes the longest time to compute, as the tauhat has to be chosen as small as
1e-7 in order to maintain the normalisation of the wave function down to 5e-5 for more than 10 dimensionless time unit.


For the Crank Nicolson integrator values of tauhat up to 1e-3 or even bigger produce results with a much higher
conservation of the normalisation down to a precision of 1e-13. The integrator conserves normalisation by construction.
Sources for a deviation from 1 lie in numerical errors and the precision of the conjugate gradient algorithm.
The calculation is faster than the Euler method by a factor of roughly 100 with the much better conservation of normalisation.


The Strang splitting does not work properly in our implementation. The wave functions do not behave as expected.
For example is the absolute value of the eigen function of the harmonic potential not time-independent, as it should be.
However the Euler integrator and the Crank Nicolson integrator show the time-independence of the eigen functions.
Even after thorough investigation of the problem, we could not find the error in our implementation. We suspect that the
casting from the double complex array containing the complex wave function into the gsl_complex_packed_array containing only
doubles (where two subsequent entries of the vector represent the real and imaginary parts from the complex vector)
might discard the imaginary part of the wave function.
